        Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole dish or large frying pan over a
        medium heat. Add the onion and a generous pinch of salt and fry for 8-10
        mins, or until the onion has turned golden brown and sticky. Add the
        garlic and ginger, cooking for a further minute
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop the chicken into chunky 3cm pieces, add to the pan and fry for 5
        mins before stirring through the spice paste and tomatoes, along with
        250ml water. Bring to the boil, lower to a simmer and cook on a gentle
        heat uncovered for 25-30 mins or until rich and slightly reduced. Stir
        though the yogurt, coriander and ground almonds, season and serve with
        warm naan or fluffy basmati rice.
